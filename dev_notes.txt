Adjacent cube masking
udfblr = [0,0,0,0,0,0]

segments =
tl, tr
ml, mr
bl, br
sl, sr
c

u -> ml + mr + (tl + tr)
d -> bl + br
f -> tr + sr
b -> ml + c + (sl + bl)
l -> tl + sl
r -> mr + c + (sr + br)

in theory 2^6 = 32 possible cubes? How many are distinct and meaningful?

blockers
b + r -> d (2^1 - 1 = 1)
b + u -> l (2^1 - 1 = 1)
r + u -> f (2^1 - 1 = 1)
b + r + u -> everything (2^3 - 1 = 7)



Elliptic arc drawing
Python PIL doesn't seem to use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm
Would be prettier if it did
